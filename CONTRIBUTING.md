### Values and Expectations
This project serves to create an organized and centralized platform where K-pop artist card collectors can easily buy and sell photo cards. The team values effective communication and collaboration therefore it is expected that others who want to contribute to this project as well uphold these values. If a contribution is made, it should be fully completed in a timely manner in order for it not to hinder the progress of the project. For example, if a new feature is to be implemented, this feature must be completed in full; a half done implementation will not be approved.

### Git Workflow
The team follows a Centralized Workflow with Feature branching when needed. Each developer clones the central repository to their own local computers, edit files and commit changes locally, and then push these changes into the master branch of the central repository. Before adding changes, the team pulls any new changes made prior to the last time they had worked on the project to ensure that no merge conflicts occur. Changes are only directly made to the master branch when all members of the team approve of it verbally otherwise changes must be made to other branches and submitted as a pull request to be reviewed and approved by the team.  

### Rules of Contributing
Make sure to contribute as much as stated and that the contribution is completed in a reasonable timeframe. When making these changes or additions, please fork the repository so that the changes will not directly affect the original project. Commit them to a different branch and submit as a pull request and wait to get the team's approval for merging. We will appreciate any contributions that may improve user experience, additional interesting features, corrections to any bugs, searching capability enhancements, etc.

### Conflict Resolution
Any disagreements or conflicts will be resolved through clear communication and compromise. If a compromise cannot be reached, then a vote will be taken on the matter or the issue will be discussed with the professor.

### Instructions for Setting Up the Local Environment
Click the fork button in the repository and from that fork, clone the repository locally from Github through terminal using **git clone URL**. Go to the location of the fork you cloned on your local computer with the **cd** command and type **git remote -v** which you should see the current configured remote repository for the fork. Then type **git remote add upstream URL** and paste the same cloned URL so that the fork is synced with the upstream repository. Next create branches for your edits with **git checkout -b nameofbranch**.

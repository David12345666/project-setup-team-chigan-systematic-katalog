# Katalog Project Repository
Katalog is a platform that aims to help photocard collectors (specifically Kpop fans) find information about specific photocards (such as average market price) and expand their photocard collection. The website will serve as an archive with information on the photocards avaliable on the market. Each photocard page will show which users are selling or trading that photocard. Katalog will also provide valuable data (such as average market price) to buyers and sellers alike.

## Short History of How the Project Came to Be
Photocards are photo inclusions that are offered in Kpop albums. A random picture of a member is given in each album. This in turn led to a huge trading market where fans trade for their favorite member's photocards and try to complete their collections, similar to baseball cards and pokemon cards trading communities. Currently, trading or purchasing transactions are done through Twitter/Instagram or other social media platforms. However, it is very difficult to find certain photocards that you need for your collection and collectors have to constantly search and monitor several different platforms to find the most ideal transaction. 

Katalog was created as a way to alleviate the difficulties of trading/selling photocards. By creating a platform where users can easily navigate to find certain photocards up for trade/sale, this facillates collections' experience with trading, buying and selling photocards.
